What we need by Lsn 15 ish: Two players connect to the same game, saved in the database. One player goes at a time, while the other watches (receives updates). The main 'game' display is the map (one of the images from the drive->Game Administration->image files). Troops are dynamically displayed based on the data in the database. Players need to be able to add troops to [anywhere] on the board, move troops from some cell to another cell on the board, limited by the troop's move stat, and be able to remove troops from the board  (suggestion a side panel from which you can manage adding and deletion). We also need to have a safe close for the game.

To Do in list format:

-Display board
-Create sidepanel (optional design)
-display troops on board based on  database
-Add troops to board
-Delete troops from board
-Move troops from cell to cell along board based on unit's move allowance.
